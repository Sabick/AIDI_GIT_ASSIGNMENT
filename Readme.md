## Cancer Prediction Using Clustering Algorithm with Elbow and Silhouette method
This project uses a clustering algorithm to analyse cancer. The number of clusters, K, is discovered using Elbow and Silhouette techniques in this K-Means procedure, with the leuanalysisNew1.csv dataset having data fewer than 30. This K-mean clustering approach, perhaps, can provide improved insights into cancer prediction.

## Prerequisites
As a pre-requisite we need python, jupyter notebook for coding and git hub to host this project.
This project requires the dataset named leuanalysisNew1.csv

## Installing
Following python libraries was imported before starting the project.

Pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
Running the tests
Dataset was loaded initially and then scaled. Optimum number of clusters was identified using Elbow and Silhouette methods. Silhouette method could be executed more than 1 time to get better Silhouette co-efficients
Using K-means ploting we plotted dataset with 5 clusters and 2 clusters to get more idea about the datapoints.
